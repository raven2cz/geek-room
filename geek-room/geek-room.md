# geek-room

**Welcome to my room!**

Greetings to all open minds here!

This channel is focused on new technologies, software features, game news and GNU/Linux :penguin:

Individual topics will be gradually covered and YT videos will be uploaded and connected. So I'm presenting a preliminary plan here too. If you are interested in other points, create an GitHub issue, we will discuss it.

There are a list of following topics

## Technical

* Polybar for DWM, AW
* Pass, gpg, passff, rofi-pass, password store, OpenKeyChain

## Distros

* MX-Linux Dailydriver
* Mabox Dailydriver
