# Project Siren: Specification

## Introduction

Project **Siren** is designed as an advanced artificial intelligence (AI), similar to Jarvis from the Marvel Universe, but primarily implemented as a local language model (LLM). This project combines a high level of autonomy with the ability to integrate cloud resources for processing more complex tasks through the OpenAI/Gemini API. The main goal is to provide users with a unique tool for interacting with the operating system and applications, extending the capabilities of current artificial intelligence technology.

## Key Components

### Local and Cloud Processing

Siren utilizes a locally running LLM from HuggingFace, specifically trained for particular uses, ensuring fast and efficient responses to most queries and tasks. For more complex operations exceeding the capacities of local processing, Siren can utilize cloud processing through integration with the OpenAI/Gemini API.

### Advanced Scripting and File System Interaction

Siren has the capability to execute precisely defined scripts, allowing for advanced manipulation of the file system and Linux services. This includes, but is not limited to, file management, task automation, and integration with various applications.

### Data Embedding and Input Data Expansion

The project allows for the integration and management of directories and files under Siren's control, expanding its ability to process and respond to queries related to the content of these files. This opens possibilities for collaboration on documents, information retrieval, and other data interactions.

### Modules for Creating and Running Custom Scripts

Siren offers tools for creating and running user-defined scripts with specific permissions, enabling automation of a wide range of tasks on the user's computer.

### Communication and Interaction

- **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Siren can communicate with users through speech, allowing for seamless interaction without the need for physical command input.
- **Integration with Home Systems:** The ability to connect to smart home systems and others via APIs and scripts extends Siren's use in everyday life.

### Interfaces and Access

Siren will be accessible through several interfaces:
- **Linux Command Line:** For advanced users and automation.
- **Web-GUI in Chat Form:** For easy and intuitive interaction with AI.
- **Speech-to-Text:** For future development and even more natural interaction with users.

### Security and Authorization

Security measures and an authentication module will ensure that critical operations require verification to prevent unauthorized manipulation of AI. Users will have control over whether to use external cloud processing for advanced analyses.

## Conclusion

Project Siren brings to life the vision of an advanced AI that is not only capable of autonomous local processing but also integrates with cloud services for extended analyses and tasks. With flexibility in script creation and execution, enhanced interactivity, and an emphasis on security, Siren promises a revolutionary approach to personal and professional productivity.
